# Dynamic_Discrete_Choice_Model
This project provides a full dynamic solution approach to predict when individuals make evacuation decisions during hurricanes. The following data is required to run the model1.
1. Houshold survey data with demographic, household and evacuation order features 
2. Time varying data on hurricane characteristics
3. Data on hurricane forecast variables such as intensity and wind speed probablities
